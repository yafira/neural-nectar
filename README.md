# 🍯 Neural Nectar

**Neural Nectar** is a series of soft, shareable machine learning experiments made with [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Designed to be poetic, playful, and emotionally expressive, these mini-web experiences explore what it means to interact with gentle intelligence.

Created as part of ongoing research into poetic computing, aesthetic ML, and cute interfaces.

## ✨ About

**Neural Nectar** is a “microbrewery” of experiments that make machine learning feel personal and alive. Each sketch is approachable, aesthetically focused, and designed for curiosity, not productivity. From mood-reactive mirrors to gesture-driven visuals, the series invites you to explore machine learning through feelings, play, and presence.

## 🍬 Experiments

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🪞 **Mood Mirror** | Analyzes your words and reflects your emotional aura with shimmering color and emoji. |
| 🍑 **Nectar Barometer** | Mic input fills a jar of digital nectar — a mood barometer for your space. |
| 🌸 **Pose Petals** | Your hand (or nose, eyes, elbows etc.) movements bloom into glowing flower trails. |
| 🔮 *(More coming soon...)* | Stay tuned for future experiments that bring neural sweetness to your screen. |

## 🌸 Aesthetic Philosophy

**Neural Nectar** embraces softness, slowness, and emotional interaction in computing.
It's about *gentle intelligence*, not artificial dominance.
Every sketch is an offering — a quiet ritual between human and machine.

## ⭐️ Inspiration

* **Poetic Computation** – influenced by Taeyoon Choi and the School for Poetic Computation
* **Cute Interfaces** – inspired by Tamagotchi, Polly Pocket, and retro-futuristic design
* **Accessible ML** – using [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) to democratize experimentation and joy
